I’m Vibha and I look forward to learning with everyone during the semester.\n\nA few things about me, in no particular order:\n\nMy academic background is in anthropology and sociology.\nI have a phobia of birds and am especially terrified of pigeons.\nI love exploring various neighborhoods of NYC in terms of their histories and the often forgotten and unnoticed elements of these areas, including older roads, buildings, and hidden waterways.\nThe two points above often come into conflict, but I persist and give great walking tours of many NYC areas despite the pigeons!\nI am an adjunct at Queens College.\nI have a basic knowledge of statistics and data analytics, but I’m taking classes at Baruch to improve in these areas and (re)learn R and python.\nMy research interests are mainly public health and climate change, and I would love to work on these\nI like elephants.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like elephants!\n\n\n\nLast Updated: Thursday 02 13, 2025 at 21:51PM"
